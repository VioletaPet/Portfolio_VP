      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>StreamCaddy was built through effective teamwork and robust project management practices. We used Zoom for real-time communication and pair programming, Slack for sharing codes and notes and Trello to track tasks and progress. The TMDB API was central to providing up-to-date information on movies and TV shows, ensuring a rich browsing and watchlist experience. By combining these tools with our development skills, we created a cohesive and user-centric application that addresses a real-world need for streamers.</p>

              <p>I had the privilege of being responsible for the complete development of the media show page, both on the backend and frontend. On the backend, I wrote the logic to fetch all the displayed data including episodes, seasons, cast, synopsis, and more from the TMDB API, ensuring accurate and efficient integration of the vast dataset. I also implemented the CRUD operation required for this page, enabling seamless data handling. On the frontend, I focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing layout. I designed the tab navigation to provide users with easy access to different sections ensuring a clear and user-friendly interface.
              The backdrop gallery was another feature I crafted, enhancing the page’s aesthetic appeal and immersiveness by showcasing media-related images. The display of genres was carefully styled to maintain consistency and clarity, contributing to an engaging user experience. Additionally, I developed the logic to dynamically display the streaming provider's logo in the top-right corner of the poster, enabling users to quickly identify where the media is available for viewing. This feature not only added a layer of functionality but also aligned with the app's goal of streamlining subscription management.</p>

The list of available user providers was sourced from the TMDb API, but rather than fetching all available providers, we limited the number of options to offer a curated selection. This ensured a more streamlined user experience, allowing for efficient management of their streaming preferences.<br>*My contributions:*<br>While my teammate was responsible for the frontend development, I focused on the backend, specifically implementing the CRUD operations for managing the user's selected streaming providers.</p>

This schedule provides a clear overview of the platforms to subscribe to and when, optimizing the user's streaming experience.<br>*My contributions:*<br>My contribution to this feature was both in frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I designed the overall layout for the general schedule as well as the display for each month's schedule, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing presentation.

      <div class="content-block">
        <p>StreamCaddy marked our second collaborative project as a team, completed within a two-week timeframe. Over this period, we saw significant progress in both our technical abilities and teamwork, particularly when compared to our first project, RentaPet. The project was structured into two focused phases: the first week dedicated to backend development, where we honed our skills in API integration and data modeling, and the second week focused on frontend development, where we applied our growing expertise in creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. Through consistent communication using tools like Slack, Zoom, and Trello, we maintained a well-organized workflow, which was essential for efficiently overcoming the challenges that arose. The experience reinforced the importance of collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability. StreamCaddy stands as a reflection of our continuous improvement as a team. We are proud of the results achieved, particularly in user experience design and technical integration, and we look forward to applying the lessons learned in future projects.</p>
