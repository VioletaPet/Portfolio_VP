      <div class="content-block">
        <p>StreamCaddy marked our second collaborative project as a team, completed within a two-week timeframe. Over this period, we saw significant progress in both our technical abilities and teamwork, particularly when compared to our first project, RentaPet. The project was structured into two focused phases: the first week dedicated to backend development, where we honed our skills in API integration and data modeling, and the second week focused on frontend development, where we applied our growing expertise in creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. Through consistent communication using tools like Slack, Zoom, and Trello, we maintained a well-organized workflow, which was essential for efficiently overcoming the challenges that arose. The experience reinforced the importance of collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability. StreamCaddy stands as a reflection of our continuous improvement as a team. We are proud of the results achieved, particularly in user experience design and technical integration, and we look forward to applying the lessons learned in future projects.</p>
