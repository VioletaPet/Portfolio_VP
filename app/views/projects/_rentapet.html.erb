      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>The successful development of RentaPet was made possible through strong team collaboration and the use of several tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Zoom: The team worked closely together, staying on a Zoom call throughout the day to ensure instant communication and quick resolutions to any challenges</li>
          <li>Slack: Used for additional communication and for sharing important updates or code snippets</li>
          <li>Notion: Served as the central platform for planning and organizing the project. Tasks, deadlines, and project milestones were tracked here to keep everyone aligned</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This collaborative approach enabled us to work efficiently, tackle challenges together, and ensure the project stayed on track</p>

      <h2>Team Collaboration</h2>
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>For the foundational structure of the application, my team and I worked together to establish the core components:<br>
        The routes, controllers, models, and the database schema, ensuring everything was well-integrated from the start. This joint effort allowed us to build a solid backend framework that would support all the features of the platform, from pet listings to bookings. Each team member contributed their expertise to ensure a smooth and efficient structure for the application to function seamlessly.</p>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <div class="content-block">
        <p>Many people dream of owning a dog but may lack the time or space to care for one full-time. Others might wish to spend time with a horse but find the costs of ownership prohibitive. RentaPet provides a creative and practical solution to these challenges by connecting people with their favorite animals and allowing them to rent pets on their own terms, whether for a few hours or a weekend.</p>

        <p>RentaPet was a rewarding project and exciting learning experience for our entire team, combining creativity and collaboration to bring our idea to life.<br>
        We utilized tools and technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL to build a functional and user-friendly platform.<br>
        As this was our first project as a team, we honed our skills in pair programming, task delegation and collaborative workflows, which were curcial for staying organized and meeting our goals.<br>
        Deploying on Heroku presented its own set of challenges of deployment-specific issues we had to debug while staying focused under tight deadlines. This project was a valuable experience that strengthened both our technical expertise and teamwork.</p>
